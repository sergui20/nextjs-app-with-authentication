/**
 * 7.1: Adding route protection to pages.
 * We want to redirect users to avoid accessing the profile page if they are not
 * authenticated.
 * 
 * With "useSession" sometimes "loading" stays true, and it doesn't really update. 
 * We are not sure if it's a bug or a feature, but it is what it is. Thankfully,
 * there is a way around that, though. Besides "useSession", there also is 'getSession'.
 * And the difference is that with "useSession", we immediately get the "session" 
 * and "loading" values, and then both session and loading could change if session 
 * data was fetched. If we have no session because we're logged out, the session 
 * will never change, though, and, as we see, loading unfortunately also doesn't change. 
 * It stays true.
 * 
 * "getSession" works differently. "getSession" sends a new request and gets the 
 * latest session data, and we can then react to the answer or the response for 
 * that request. And that allows us to manage our own loading state while fetching 
 * the session and act accordingly. It's a bit more cumbersome and requires more 
 * work from our side, but it is the way around this issue that we have here.
 * 
 * So, with "useSession" if we rely on the differences between being in a loading 
 * state and not having a session or not having a session because we're not 
 * authenticated directly after loading a page. In that case, "useSession" didn't 
 * help us, and this is what "getSession" does.
 * 
 * 8.1: Adding server-side route protection to pages.
 * "getSession" is not limited to client-side only as we did it in "user-profile.js"
 * component.
 * 
 * In the previous lecture we protected the profile page and redirected away for 
 * not authenticated users. But there is a brief moment of "loading", which flashes 
 * on the screen when we enter profile when not authenticated, that is maybe 
 * something we want to get rid of. Now, we can't really get rid of it with just 
 * client-side code because if we visit this page and we then use client-side 
 * JavaScript code to determine whether we are authenticated or not, then we'll 
 * always need to wait that fraction of a second to find out if we are. But we must 
 * not forget that Next.js blends server-side and client-side code, so we can use 
 * server-side code to determine whether the user, who sent the request, is 
 * authenticated or not and return different page content and possibly a redirect 
 * if the user is not authenticated.
 * 
 * So, let's use "getSession" and pass the entire incoming request. 
 * And then, "getSession" will automatically look into that request and extract 
 * the data it needs, the session token cookie, to be preciseâ€”and see if that's valid,
 * and if the user is authenticated and if that cookie even exists to begin with.
